# AMRAM: Acosta Martin Race Application Mechanics

## What in the Fender is AMRAM? 

AMRAM is the pursuit of one of my favorite passions: speed. Not necessarily in a competitive nature, but the feel of mobility, the rush of 
taking risks, and learning from loss, and celebrating those wins. 

## Who are we? 

A pair of Software/Mechanical engineers who have decided to strike out on their own as weekend warriors at the track, and tell their tales
of successes, failures, and lessons learned.
